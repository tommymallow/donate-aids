        <p>Godfrey's name and identity have been changed to protect his privacy.</p>
        <p>An orphan at the age of 12, Godfry began exhibiting HIV symptoms only a few short days after his mother's death.</p>
        <p>Godfry was so devastated by the news that he tried to hang himself. Thankfully, the rope snapped and social workers at his Compassion-assisted child development center immediately intervened. Today, through the support of Compassion's AIDS program, he is on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and is defying the disease.</p>
        <p>Because of your donations, children like Godfry are able to fight back against the devastating spread of AIDS.</p>
